### Project Architecture
Please read this Readme File before evaluating codebase.

MVVM + CLEAN Principles

The Code base is neatly **Documented**

In this project I used
- *Koin* for depedency Injection
- *Room* for local caching of data
- *shimmer* for showing the loading progress (note : I had delayed responses from server for 1 sec to show shimmer)
- *Diff Util* to efficiently Update the data
- *StateFlows* to update the UI
- *flow operations* for functions such as searching
- *Glide* to load images
- *splash screen* to show branding image at cold start.
- Neatly Documnted Code
